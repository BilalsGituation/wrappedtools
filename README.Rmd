## Installation

You can install the released version of wrappedtools from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("abusjahn/wrappedtools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem,
that is, describe and test differences in some measures between 2 samples,
rounding descriptive statistics to a reasonable precision in the process:

```{r example}
library(wrappedtools)
compare2numvars(data = mtcars, testvars = c('wt','mpg', "disp"), 
                groupvar = 'am',
                gaussian = F,
                round_desc = 3)
```
