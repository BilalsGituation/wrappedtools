Title: Usefull Wrappers Around Commonly Used Functions
Description: This is a set of functions data scientists and data janitors 
    need frequently, so partly this is yet another toolbelt package. 
    Functions were mainly written for my own daily work or teaching, 
    but may be of use to others as well.
